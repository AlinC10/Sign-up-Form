# Sign-up-Form
## About the project
This project was made as part of The Odin Project <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">curriculum</a>.

The main objective was to create a form that is user-friendly, aesthtically pleasing and functional across all devices. The form collect essential data and sets the stage for integration into a real authentification system.

**Live Demo:**  https://alinc10.github.io/Sign-up-Form/

## How was made
Tech used: HTML, CSS
The form was made using **Grid Layout** to create a 2 inputs on a row layout and to make the site responsive. If the site becomes to small to accomodate 2 inputs on a row, it will move one to the next row and will make the input width equal to the form width. 

Form validation is made using **HTML5 validation rules** and for emails I added a pattern to enhance the email capabilities.
